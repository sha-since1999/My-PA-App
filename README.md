Script of  mPA app

This is my Pocket academy app in short mPA App for managing assignment and tutorials for any college .
Basic we know there is a lot of app provide this type of feature but our intension to create this project to provide easy and reliable Ui for such app with minimum depth so that I have tried to create this  easy user understandable  app for for managing assignment / tutorial and notice for any college  at current  this app has certain limitation and  boundaries but in future we can scale as per requirement.

In this  app there is  mainly three type of module
1 faculty module 
2 student module 
3 admin module 


-  In faculty module  faculty can create the  notice  and  can view the list of previously created notice and can create assignment / tutorials for a particular  year , branch or  section and can view the assignment submitted by the student  and  can mark the assignment and  send them an acknowledgement mail and  can able to see list of students who have submitted particular assignment .
-  Faculty either can write question of  assignment directly  in app or can upload a document  of file  or pdf of assignment .
-  There is option of recent box in which  faculty can  check  recently submitted assignment  by student.
- And  in this  app there is  also section  of ERP  which is  not implemented yet this will come under  future scope of my  project .

- In student module student can view circulated notice on notice board and can submit assignment to the respective faculty  and view detail of assignment like when assignment has been created and what is the due date of submission  of assignment  and  even after due date, student  also can submit their assignment but that will not be consider for marking  and student will get a mail of late submission.

- Admin module is very  simple  this  have all authorities to view and  manipulate  data of each user in this  admin dashboard  again there is  two type of module on  faculty and student  in which admin filter faculty by department  and  student according to semester and year.  After that  admin can directly land to that particular userâ€™s dashboard . ok.. this will be more clear  in live demo(it will be posted soon..)

During  the lunchtime this app will  check for user login if user had not logout last time then user would not have to login again  it will  be automatically login  and  otherwise on using  any module it firstly  ask for  either login of registration  to the respective user (means are you student or faculty it will ask for first time )

In this  app there I have done with  a requirement phase , design	phase , and implementation phase  and  only   50 % data binding part  is remain to complete.

Basically  for this this app I have used swift 5  and firebase ,  Figma  , and a lot of helping tools and technologies and Xcode as editor  for  managing whole project.
